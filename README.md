#  OS Concepts Visualizer

## üìù Abstract

<details>
  
The OS Concepts Visualizer is an interactive, web-based educational tool designed to visually demonstrate core concepts of Operating Systems through real-time algorithm simulations. The platform covers a wide range of topics including CPU scheduling, memory management, file systems, deadlock detection, and disk scheduling. By offering a modular interface and intuitive visualizations, the simulator enables students and educators to explore complex OS mechanisms in an engaging and practical manner. This tool serves as a bridge between theoretical learning and hands-on experience, significantly enhancing comprehension of concepts in operating systems.
